      position: Owner, Kowri Estate, Koppa
      details: I have tried many different coffees before but Express coffee has the most authentic south Indian taste due to perfect blend of Coffee and Chicory without too much diluting the coffee flavour. Express classic and Ujwal offer enjoyable blend with right bitterness one can expect from pure Chikmagaluru coffee
